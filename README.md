## Hello,

🎓 I am a freshman at Cedarville University working towards a bachelors in IT Management with a focus on Cyber Management.

💻 Alongside my academic studies, I am independantly learning Python and Bash.

🔗 I am currently experimenting with LLMs with the future expectation to be able to specifically tailor them for automating systems, increasing workflow efficiency.
