## Hello, I am Integrated-G.

🎓 I am a freshman at Cedarville University working towards a bachelors in IT Management with a Cyber Management focus.

💻 Along with my academic studies, I am independantly learning Python, Bash, PowerShell, for system automation.

🔗 I am also currently experimenting with LLMs with the future expectation to be able to specifically tailor them for automating systems to increase workflow and efficiency.

☁️ In regards to efficient automation, I am dabbling in cloud computing for comparing the cost efficiency of cloud vs local computing.
